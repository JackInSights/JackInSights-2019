# JackInSights-2019
Static Website for Statistics

Inspired by Daniel Hritzkiv Annual Report series, JackInSights - 2019 is an excercise in personal data collection and reflection. I had previously mapped out this data using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets but with the advent of tracking applicaitons this is significantly easier. This website will be static but I hope as I learn to code I will be able to make it more interactable.

Tracking via Excel Sheet which is taking in data from the following sources:

- RescueTime
- Samsung Health (Steps)
- Samsung Health (Sleep)
- Samsung Health (Weight)
- Pushups (Manual Tracking)
- MyFitnessPal (Food)
- WallyNext (Finance)
- Finance (Manual Tracking)
- FitNotes (Gym)
- Journey.Cloud (Diary) - Manually Tracked
- AudioBooks (Audible) - Manually Tracked
- AudioBooks (Blinkist) - Manually Tracked

Next year I need to figure out either to API call the data I need or from CSV files exported from these services.
