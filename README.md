# JackInSights-2019
Static Website for Statistics

Inspired by Daniel Hritzkiv Annual Report series, JackInSights - 2019 is an excercise in personal data collection and reflection. I had previously mapped out this data using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets but with the advent of tracking applicaitons this is significantly easier. This website will be static but I hope as I learn to code I will be able to make it more interactable.
